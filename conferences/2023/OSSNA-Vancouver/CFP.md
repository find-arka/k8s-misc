If you are running Kubernetes clusters, or if you are deploying your applications on Kubernetes clusters, chances are high that at some point you started with "kubectl" CLI. As time progressed, maybe you have created aliases to reduce running redundant commands and save some precious time. You might also be using kubectl auto-completion to make life easier. If you want to take your cluster interactions to the next level, and if you love your terminal window, k9s is "the tool" for you.

In this talk, Arka would love to share some of the K9s features that he absolutely loves and uses regularly. Some of these are:
- Running K9s on a multi-terminal-window, to view the state of multiple Kubernetes clusters on the same view.
- Observing live deployments.
- Switching between cluster contexts.
- Scaling a set of Kubernetes Deployments together.
- Deleting a set of resources together.
- Easily run "kubectl get" equivalent commands using simple keystrokes.
- Viewing the decoded value of a Kubernetes secret with just one hotkey.
- Viewing live logs of pods.
